# Quickstart

```bash
npm install --save fission-codes
```

```solidity
// Solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
import "/fission-codes/contracts/Status.sol";
```

```js
// JS
const fission = require('fission-codes');
```

# Example

```solidity
contract Foo {
  constructor () {
  }

  function {
  }
}

contract Bar {
}

contract Baz {
}
```

# Motivation

## Autonomy

Smart contracts are largely intended to be autonomous. While each contract may define a specific interface, having a common set of semantic codes can help developers write code that can react appropriately to various situations.

## Semantically Rich

HTTP status codes are widely used for this purpose. BEAM languages use atoms and tagged tuples to signify much the same information. Both provide a lot of information both to the programmer (debugging for instance), and to the program that needs to decide what to do next.

FISSIONs convey a much richer set of information than booleans, and are able to be reacted to autonomously unlike arbitrary strings.

## User Feedback

Since status codes are finite and known in advance, we can provide global, human-readable sets of status messages. These may also be translated into any language, differing levels of technical detail, added as `revert` messages, natspecs, and so on.

We also see a desire for this [in transactions](http://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-658), and there's no reason that FISSIONs couldn't be used by the EVM itself.
